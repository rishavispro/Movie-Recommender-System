# Movie Recommender System
 
The Movie Recommender System is a content-based recommendation project using machine learning
techniques to offer personalized movie suggestions. By analyzing movie metadata such as genre, plot
overview, and cast, the system computes similarities between movies and recommends best-matched options
for a given input.
